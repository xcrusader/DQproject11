# DQproject11
An e-Learning platform has asked us to identify markets in which they can advertise their online classes which currently specialize in courses related to mobile and web development. 

In order to carry out research on this top we make use of the survey created by freeCodeCamp in which they surveyed new coders who were interested in coding. Based on the participant responses to what we believe were objective questions we identify markets in which the e-learning platform can advertise their product to.

The emphasis of the project was to drive in the concepts of statistics in data analysis.
